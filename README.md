# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
 Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Repo

This is a repository that contains files and scripts related to the downloading and cleaning of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set available at the Machine Learning Repository of the University of California Irvine (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#). This is a peer-graded assignment for Week 4 of the course Getting and Cleaning Data, part of the Data Science Specialization, offered by Johns Hopkins University in Coursera.

- README.md: This file.
- getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip: Zip file that containes the data sets and corresponding support files.
- UCI HAR Dataset folder: Folder containing the data sets and corresponding support files.
- run_analysis.R: Script that downloads and tidies the data sets as part of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. It also creates a tidy data set with the averages of the means and standard deviations grouped by subject and activity.
- CodeBook.md: Markdown file that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
- Clean Database Means.txt: New and independent data set that shows the averages of the means and standard deviations for each accelerometer and gyroscopic measurement, grouped by subject and activity.
